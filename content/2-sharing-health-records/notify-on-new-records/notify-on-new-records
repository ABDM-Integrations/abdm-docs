###Updated SMS Notify2 API###
ABDM plans to ensure that users are aware of which health facilities are participating in ABDM. HRPs are expected to notify ABDM whenever a new health record is created using this API.

The expected User flow is given below

- Patient visits a health facility and registers by providing Name, DoB, Gender and Mobile. Patient does not share any ABHA address with the facility.
- If the Health Facility is participating in ABDM, then it will notify ABDM when there is a new health record for this patient. Only the mobile number and the HIP ID of the facility is notified. Facilities are identified by the facilityâ€™s HIPCODE. This can be obtained by registering the facility using the Health Facility Registry and linking the facility to a ABDM approved Health Repository Provider Software.
- ABDM will send an SMS to the user with a deep link.
Following API must be be used by HRPs for the same -
