# What is UHI?

The Unified Health Interface (UHI) is envisioned to be a network of open protocols that will enable the interoperability of health services in India. UHI will be another foundational layer in the National Digital Health Ecosystem that will focus on the discoverability and transaction of health services.  While the current ABDM building blocks enable the interoperable exchange of personal health data and provide registries for key ecosystem players such as doctors and health facilities, UHI integrates with these building blocks to allow seamless and interoperable health services such as teleconsultation. UHI is taking an ‘Open Network’ approach to build the gateway and to enable the creation of a nationwide, decentralized, open, and inclusive network. It will be provide a system to facilitate the discovery of services between user facing applications and health service provider applications. Open access across diverse health service providers and patients can drastically expand demand-supply ecosystems and transform the digital healthcare landscape in India.

# UHI Services 

The services on UHI will include, but not be limited to, Teleconsultation, Booking Physical Appointments, Lab Bookings, Ambulatory Services and Blood Donation 

# UHI Participants 

Any service transaction in UHI involves five entities:

**User**: Patients seeking digital health services through UHI. 

**End User Application (EUA)**: User-facing applications offering digital health services 

**UHI Gateway**: Layer routing requests and responses involved in UHI transactions between HSPAs and EUAs

**Health Service Provider Application (HSPA)**: Provider-facing applications allowing doctors to respond to EUA requests and fulfill digital health services 

**Health Service Provider (HSP)**: Providers of healthcare services

# Role of the UHI Gateway 

The role of the gateway in a UHI service transaction is limited to the search and discoverability of health services. For example, if a user searches for teleconsultation services on an EUA, the gateway routes the request to all available HSPAs and sends back the responses to the EUA. The booking, payment and fulfillment of the service, thereafter, is done directly between the EUA and the HSPA.

# What is DHP? 
Decentralized Health Protocols aim to define the interoperable protocol specifications for creating a decentralized network of health services. The purpose of DHP APIs is to enable interoperability between Healthcare providers (doctors, paramedical, health facilities, etc.) and Healthcare consumers. The DHP architecture and APIs allow individuals/ organizations to set up an open network of consumer side applications and provide side platforms using common protocol specifications. The DHP renders open APIs, schemas and example flows for the different use cases in healthcare.
