# Setup for Physical Consultation 

The setup for physical appointments is similar to setting up a teleconsultation service except the doctor doesn't need to provide their signature for signing the prescriptions. 
- Set up Calendar/availability
- Provide their fees/charges
- Provide bank details/UPI address to receive payments
