## For contributors

- This documentation uses [Hugo](gohugo.io) to build the final documentation site.
- The folder structure is very important. All pages are under the directory "content"
- Each folder under content represents a chapter
- The _index.md page contains the content for the chapter's starting page
- You can add as many pages to a chapter or create a new folder to create a sub-chapter
- The order of the pages are controlled by the "weight" parameter in the header of each page
- All pages are written using Markdown - Editor: [dillinger markdown editor](dillinger.io) and [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) 
- Put images and other resources in the static folder. To reference your image in your content the path would be /abdm-docs/img/<filename>
